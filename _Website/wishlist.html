  <h2>Support</h2>
    <h3>Support for Korg workstations like X1, X2, X3 etc.</h3>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Description</td><td>Add support for Korg workstations like X1, X2, X3 etc.</td>
        <tr><td>Rationale</td><td>Owners of those workstations also want to use PCG Tools</td>
        <tr><td>Requester</td><td>Owners of those workstations</td>
        <tr><td>Implementation</td><td>-</td>
        <tr><td>Open Issues</td><td>-</td>
      </table>

    <h3>Support for Korg synthesizers like KingKorg, Electribe  etc.</h3>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Description</td><td>Add support for Korg synthesizers like KingKorg, Electribe etc.</td>
        <tr><td>Rationale</td><td>Owners of those synthesizers also want to use PCG Tools</td>
        <tr><td>Requester</td><td>Owners of those synthesizers</td>
        <tr><td>Implementation</td><td>-</td>
        <tr><td>Open Issues</td><td>-</td>
      </table>

    <h3>Support for Korg arrangers like PA series etc.</h3>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Description</td><td>Add support for Korg arrangers like PA series etc.</td>
        <tr><td>Rationale</td><td>Owners of those arrangers also want to use PCG Tools</td>
        <tr><td>Requester</td><td>Owners of those arrangers</td>
        <tr><td>Implementation</td><td>-</td>
        <tr><td>Open Issues</td><td>-</td>
      </table>

  <h2>Connectivity</h2>
    <h3>MIDI support for direct connection</h3>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Description</td><td>Add MIDI support for direct connection, so that MIDI can be used to transfer sounds directly, instead of loading/saving PCG files or using external utilities like MIDIOX.</td>
        <tr><td>Rationale</td><td>Easier workflow, adding audition and editor features becomes interesting because the transfer workflow is easier/faster.</td>
        <tr><td>Requester</td><td>-</td>
        <tr><td>Implementation</td><td>-</td>
        <tr><td>Open Issues</td><td>For some workstations MIDI is probably too slow (Kronos), also testing will be very time consuming.</td>
      </table>

  <h2>GUI</h2>
    <h3>Auto save PCG Files (every x seconds)</h3>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Description</td><td>Auto save the changed PCG file(s) every x seconds, where x can be defined in the settings. This option can be enabled or disabled.
Also optionally, a rename (version) can be used, or the last y files are saved.</td>
        <tr><td>Rationale</td><td>Users do not want to loose changes.</td>
        <tr><td>Requester</td><td></td>
        <tr><td>Implementation</td><td></td>
        <tr><td>Open Issues</td><td>Since there is no Undo/Redo overwriting the original file might be hazardous.</td>
      </table>

    <h3>Drag & Drop Patches</h3>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Description</td><td>Currently, only cursor and short cut keys can be used to move/copy/paste patches. It would be nice if the mouse can also be used (called drag & drop).</td>
        <tr><td>Rationale</td><td>Easier/faster and more intuitive workflow.</td>
        <tr><td>Requester</td><td></td>
        <tr><td>Implementation</td><td></td>
        <tr><td>Open Issues</td><td>Since a copy/paste action is split in one copy but multiple paste actions, a simple drag & drop is not possible, for moving patches it is.
          However, for copy/paste, the first action should be possible by drag & drop, consecutive pasting can be done with the keyboard.</td>
      </table>

    <h3>Tip of the Day</h3>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Description</td><td>When starting the application, show a tip of the day.</td>
        <tr><td>Rationale</td><td>Not everybody reads the manual and this gives an easy way to learn more or unknown features. It could be combined with the splash screen.
       Also, it should be possible to disable this feature (stored in settings).</td>
        <tr><td>Requester</td><td></td>
        <tr><td>Implementation</td><td></td>
        <tr><td>Open Issues</td><td></td>
      </table>

    <h3>Read ZIP files</h3>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Description</td><td>Read ZIP files and automatically extract (and open) PCG or SNG files.</td>
        <tr><td>Rationale</td><td>A lot of downloadable files are in ZIP format. This would prevent a user operation to unzip the files.</td>
        <tr><td>Requester</td><td></td>
        <tr><td>Implementation</td><td></td>
        <tr><td>Open Issues</td><td>Where to store the PCG file? And what to do with a lot of PCG files to be opened (can take time)?</td>
      </table>

    <h3>Undo/Redo</h3>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Description</td><td>Currently there is no undo/redo functionality, meaning that if the user makes a mistake, it cannot undo the operation (automatically).</td>
        <tr><td>Rationale</td><td>Copy & Paste sometimes result in an unwanted result, undoing the operation would be a nice feature.</td>
        <tr><td>Requester</td><td></td>
        <tr><td>Implementation</td><td>Memento design pattern. Or copy the complete content (better: changed content)</td>
        <tr><td>Open Issues</td><td>Very hard to implement, especially with copy & paste, since a lot of data needs to be stored per undoable action (can end in megabytes per undoable action).</td>
      </table>

    <h3>Define multiple view alternatives for the status bar</h3>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Description</td><td>Define more than the current single (and quite long) format of the status bar.</td>
        <tr><td>Rationale</td><td>Currently the status bar contains the workstation model PCG file, the version, the type of opened file and in case of a PCG file, the number of all patches in the selected PCG and the contents of the clipboard buffer. This line can be very long and not everybody uses wide screen monitors. Therefor multiple views should be added.</td>
        <tr><td>Requester</td><td></td>
        <tr><td>Implementation</td><td>
          Mainly the listing of patches can be smaller.<br>
          The current view should become the default/long view (although changing spaces by commas would be nice like:<br>
          > 23 programs in 5 banks, 3 combis in 2 banks, 125 set list slots in 5 set lists, 3 wave sequences in 1 bank, 25 drum kits in 2 banks.<br>
          A smaller format could be (for patches):<br>
          > 23 programs, 3 combis, 125 set list slots, 3 wave sequences, 25 drum kits.<br>
          An even smaller format could be:<br>
          > 23P, 3C, 125 SLS, 3WS, 25DK</td>
        <tr><td>Open Issues</td><td></td>
      </table>

  <h2>Copy & Paste</h2>

    <h3>Show uncopied patches reason</h3>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Description</td><td>When cut/copy/pasting results in no copy/paste a big window is shown with all possible reasons. This should be split into the exact reason.
Also when pasting programs in incompatible program banks (i.e. modeled versus sampled) no warning/error is shown.</td>
        <tr><td>Rationale</td><td>Easier to see what is the reason of uncopied/pasted patches.</td>
        <tr><td>Requester</td><td></td>
        <tr><td>Implementation</td><td></td>
        <tr><td>Open Issues</td><td></td>
      </table>

    <h3>Possibility to copy/paste individual timbres of combis</h3>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Description</td><td>Add cut/copy/paste of timbres inside a combi.
Also preferably, add cut/copy/paste between timbres.</td>
        <tr><td>Rationale</td><td>This functionality is not available on a workstation.</td>
        <tr><td>Requester</td><td></td>
        <tr><td>Implementation</td><td></td>
        <tr><td>Open Issues</td><td>How to handle effects? Will there be KARMA issues? How to handle copy/pasting timbres to another PCG file that does not have the referenced programs?</td>
      </table>

    <h3>Copy/Paste between Oasys/Kronos patches</h3>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Description</td><td>Copy/Paste patches between Korg Oasys and Kronos, for those patches that have compatible EXis.</td>
        <tr><td>Rationale</td><td>The Oasys cannot read Kronos patches.</td>
        <tr><td>Requester</td><td></td>
        <tr><td>Implementation</td><td></td>
        <tr><td>Open Issues</td><td>How to handle programs/combis using incompatible EXis? Different samples/sample set.</td>
      </table>

     <h3>Insert patch in PCG window</h3>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Description</td><td>In a PCG window, instead of overwriting a patch that is pasted, insert it.</td>
        <tr><td>Rationale</td><td>Currently it is overwritten (or not possible to overwrite).</td>
        <tr><td>Requester</td><td></td>
        <tr><td>Implementation</td><td>Add option in preference to select between giving a warning if a patch is deleted (the last of the bank) or if it should be possible or not.</td>
        <tr><td>Open Issues</td><td>Warning or error when the last patch should be removed? How to get an empty patch?</td>
      </table>

    <h3>Wave sequences and drum kits copy/pasting (including reference remapping)</h3>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Description</td><td>When currently patches are copied, wave sequences and drum kits are not taken into account.</td>
        <tr><td>Rationale</td><td>When pasting patches to other PCG files, when using the non default wave sequences or drum kits it might break the sound.</td>
        <tr><td>Requester</td><td></td>
        <tr><td>Implementation</td><td></td>
        <tr><td>Open Issues</td><td></td>
      </table>

  <h2>MID/SYX Files</h2>
    <h3>Handle files with multiple parts</h3>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Description</td><td>Handle files which have multiple SYX fragments in them.</td>
        <tr><td>Rationale</td><td>Currently only the first fragement is loaded. Typically some Korg M1 files have multiple fragments.</td>
        <tr><td>Requester</td><td></td>
        <tr><td>Implementation</td><td>Various alternatives are possible:
          <ul><li>Make a tool inside PCG Tools to split the files in multiple files (easy)</li>
                <li>Load the files as separate files (medium)</li>
                <li>Merge all fragments (difficult, due to multiple 7/8 bit conversions)</li>
         </ul></td>
        <tr><td>Open Issues</td><td></td>
      </table>

       <tr><td>MID/SYX Files</td><td></td></tr>

  <h2>PCG Files</h2>

    <h3>Differ PCG files list</h3>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Description</td><td>Create a list with the difference between two PCG files (from the same workstation model).</td>
        <tr><td>Rationale</td><td>Currently it is not possible to diff two PCG files.</td>
        <tr><td>Requester</td><td></td>
        <tr><td>Implementation</td><td>Generate a list per selected patch which are different.<br>
          E.g. short list:<br>
          > Program Bank I-A: 1, 2, 6, 8, …<br>
          > Combi Bank I-C: 6, 33<br>
          E.g. long list:<br>
          > Patch Name 1 Name 2 Content Diff<br>
          > Program I-A000 Kronos Grand = 34<br>
          Meaning 34 bytes differences, = means that the names are equal.</td>
        <tr><td>Open Issues</td><td>Add global differences?</td>
      </table>

    <h3>Create new PCG file</h3>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Description</td><td>Creates a new file from the specified workstation model.
Optionally the contents can be set (which program banks, combi banks, set list slots and whether to add a global section).</td>
        <tr><td>Rationale</td><td>Currently this is not possible.</td>
        <tr><td>Requester</td><td></td>
        <tr><td>Implementation</td><td>Use a full PCG file of each workstation model and remove all banks (and global?) or create from scratch? Using a full PCG and delete all unrequested banks/global section would be easiest.</td>
        <tr><td>Open Issues</td><td>Creating from scratch will be very tricky but the most clean solution.</td>
      </table>

    <h3>Merge two PCG files</h3>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Description</td><td>Merge two PCG files, i.e. copy all programs/combis/set list slots from one PCG file to the other.</td>
        <tr><td>Rationale</td><td>Currently this is not possible.</td>
        <tr><td>Requester</td><td>Two alternatives:<br>
          Dumb: start copying until the PCG file is filled (either it is finished ok or there is not enough space).<br>
          Intelligent: First analyze duplicates, then calculate if the complete copy fits. If not, show a warning (possibility to continue).</td>
        <tr><td>Implementation</td><td></td>
        <tr><td>Open Issues</td><td>What to do if both PCG files have global settings? What to do with incomplete copies (i.e. not all programs fits, combis/set list slots use uncopied programs?)</td>
      </table>

   <h3>Convert PCG to/from SYX file</h3>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Description</td><td>Convert a PCG file to a SYX/MID file or vice versa.</td>
        <tr><td>Rationale</td><td>Flexibility.</td>
        <tr><td>Requester</td><td>Angelo V</td>
        <tr><td>Implementation</td><td></td>

    <h3>Sort banks</h3>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Description</td><td>Sort banks (or set lists) alphabetically.</td>

External timbres should be moved to the end. Timbres which are set to Off or Mute or have velocity 0 removed.</td>
        <tr><td>Rationale</td><td>When changing combis, often timbres are assigned in random order or added later. By sorting, the combi will be put in a better order.</td>
        <tr><td>Requester</td><td></td>
        <tr><td>Implementation</td><td>Add a sort button to the Timbres window. Add the possibility to leave a gap between timbres of different MIDI channels.</td>
        <tr><td>Open Issues</td><td>Should the sorting order be flexible? (e.g. added to the preferences?)

        <tr><td>Rationale</td><td>When have set list slots copied (e.g. for alphabetic order, gig order, rehearsal order), and one changes the parameters of a set list slot, a manual copy is needed for each changed patch.</td>
        <tr><td>Requester</td><td></td>
