Dear PCG Tools users,

A new version of PCG Tools is released (version 2.5.0).

The most important items are:

- Automatic pasting of programs used by combis/set list slots with programs having a similar name but not mandatory to be equal.
- Added color/transpose controls for editing set list slots (Kronos only).
- Various bug fixes (like copy/pasting set list slots for Kronos.

The application can be downloaded for free at http://pcgtools.mkspace.nl 

Below is a complete list of changes.

Kind regards,

Michel Keijzers, developer of PCG Tools
